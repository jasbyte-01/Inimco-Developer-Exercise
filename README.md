# Inimco-Developer-Exercise

This project is a full-stack web application developed as part of the Inimco Developer Exercise.
Its purpose is to showcase skills in solution design, software development, documentation, and demo presentation by implementing a small but well-structured application.

The application allows users to:

- Enter personal details (first name and last name)

- Add social skills (e.g., "social", "team player")

- Provide social media accounts (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)

Once the details are submitted, the app:

- Analyzes the name

- Counts the vowels and consonants in both first and last name.

- Reverses each name (e.g., John â†’ nhoJ).

Formats the data
-  Displays the full set of entered information in JSON format.
